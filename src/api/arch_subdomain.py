"""Host-routing wrapper factory (REQ-GHA-015).

Serves the architecture page at the ROOT of the `architecture.*` subdomain
(architecture.glasshood.ai -> the page, no /architecture/ suffix). For any other
host, or any path other than "/", this is a pure pass-through to the wrapped app.

Kept separate from src/api/server.py so the routing logic is unit-testable without
importing the full app. Mirrors TestRobin REQ-589 (xrobin backend/arch_subdomain.py).

The FileResponse here is forced to revalidate on every load (Cache-Control: no-cache,
must-revalidate), mirroring NoCacheStaticFiles (src/api/static_nocache.py) — this
bypasses that StaticFiles mount entirely, so without this header a browser caching the
subdomain root could keep serving a stale page after a content edit. See
static_nocache.py for the full rationale.
